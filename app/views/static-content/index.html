        <p>We're introducing a new remote payment system called Dart Charge to reduce congestion at the Crossing, and this means you'll no longer pay at the barriers.</p>
        <p>The Crossing will still be free to use between 10pm and 6am. There will be  a range of ways to pay, and you can get a discounted rate by registering an account.</p>
        <p>To make sure you’re ready for the change, you can use this site to register and manage a Dart Charge account, migrate a DART-Tag account and apply for a local residents’ discount.</p>
        <p><strong>Please be aware that Dart Charge accounts will not be activated until the remote charging scheme goes live later this year.</strong></p>

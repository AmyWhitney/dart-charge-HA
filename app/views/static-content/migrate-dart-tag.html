        <p>Your DART-Tag account balance will automatically transfer when the Dart Charge scheme opens. To make sure your account will work under the new payment arrangements, you now need to provide you vehicle details and add a payment card or set up a Direct Debit.</p>
        <p>You can choose to add funds to your Dart Charge balance when you migrate, but please be aware you cannot use this account to pay for crossings until the scheme goes live later this year.</p>

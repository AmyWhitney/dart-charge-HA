The *Strategy*, *Scope*, *Structure*, *Skeleton* and *Surface* sections of this document are based upon Jesse James Garrett's ***5 Planes of User Experience***. More information on this model can be found in Garrett's book, ***The Elements of User Experience***, available to buy from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0735712026/ref=nosim/jjgnet-20/).

The user flows in the Structure section are described using Garrett's [Visual Vocabulary for Information Architecture](http://jjg.net/ia/visvocab/).

## Version history

The version history of this document is based on [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) and its format of (*Major.Minor.Patch*).

However, we're writing a document, not software; therefore the format is used differently:

- **Minor**: A internal release (shared with the team)
- **Patch**: A revision by the author (not shared)

Each revision or release should be recorded in the inital section of the document.
